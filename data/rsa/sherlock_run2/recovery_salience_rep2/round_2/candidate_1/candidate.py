"""RSA pragmatic listener with a family-resemblance typicality prior over referents.

Listeners evaluate referents through a family-resemblance typicality prior (Rosch &
Mervis 1975): candidate objects are evaluated by the extent to which they share visual
features with other objects in the display. Listeners incorporate this contextual
typicality prior into their generative model of the speaker and use it as their default
choice distribution on uninformative prior trials.
