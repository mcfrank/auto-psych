"""Non-Bayesian heuristic listener selecting referents with the fewest features.

Rather than recursively simulating an informative speaker, the listener applies
a direct feature economy heuristic: filtering to referents that literally
satisfy the uttered word, the listener chooses among them with a penalty
proportional to the number of extraneous features. Objects with fewer total
features are preferred as the most minimally specified referents of the word.
In the absence of an informative utterance, choices are uniform.
