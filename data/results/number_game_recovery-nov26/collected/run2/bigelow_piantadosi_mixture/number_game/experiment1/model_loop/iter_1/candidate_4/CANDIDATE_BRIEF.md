# Candidate Brief

Refine the incumbent: `tenenbaum_digit_concepts` — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -918.2. Its hypothesis, as its author stated it:

> Refinement of `tenenbaum_rules_similarity`: people do Bayesian concept learning over Tenenbaum's mathematical rules and size-weighted intervals, but they also read the examples as written numerals, so their hypothesis space additionally contains digit concepts — "contains the digit d" (for each digit 0–9) and "ends in 0" — sharing the rules' equal prior. The one change is adding these digit concepts, which predicts that examples sharing a digit (e.g. 83, 38, 58, 68) lead people to say yes to other numbers containing that digit (e.g. 84, 87), even when those numbers are far from any arithmetic rule.

Its source is `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment1/model_loop/models/tenenbaum_digit_concepts.py`. Read it before you write anything.

Produce the version of this model you believe would beat it on the current data: keep the mechanism that makes it win and change what it gets wrong — a different functional form, prior or normalisation of its mechanism, a cue it ignores, or a component taken from another model in `refinement_menu.md`. For this slot the rule against grafting cues from other models onto a hypothesis is lifted, and so is the rule against composing mechanisms: you may add a component from another model. Two things still hold: make **one** deliberate, stated change (a grab-bag of cues added to fit better is not a refinement), and change something that matters — the novelty gate rejects a candidate whose predictions match a live model's across the stimulus space, the incumbent's included.

Say in `hypothesis.md` which model you refined and what you changed: that is part of the claim.

If `critiques.md` is present, prioritise a hypothesis that addresses one of the significant discrepancies it reports.
