# Existing hypotheses

Each model below is ONE cognitive hypothesis, with how it stands on the current data by ELPD-LOO (best first). `elpd_diff ± dse` is a model's deficit against the best and the standard error of that difference (with the responses to each stimulus pair counted together, as they are correlated): within about 2·dse the two are statistically tied on this data; beyond it the model has lost. "PSIS-LOO unreliable" means the estimate itself is untrustworthy (too many high-Pareto-k trials), not that the model is bad. Propose a hypothesis that is genuinely different from these, or a refinement of a single one of them — never a combination of several.

## bigelow_piantadosi_independent  — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -926.6

Bayesian concept learning over 45 rules (odd, even, primes, squares,
cubes, powers of 2-10, powers of 2 without 32 or with 37, multiples of
3-9, 11 and 12, ending in 0-9, containing the digit 0-9) and every
interval of 1-100, with a prior weight inferred for each rule separately
and a share lambda_0 for the rules as a group; each interval has prior
(1 - lambda_0) / 100^2. Examples are sampled from the concept (the size
principle), 10% of them uniformly from 1-100, and "yes" is the posterior
probability that the concept contains the target.

## tenenbaum_rules_similarity  — rank 1, 322.5 ± 41.8 nats behind the best (7.7× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1249.1

Bayesian concept learning over 33 mathematical rules (odd, even, squares,
cubes, primes, multiples of 3-12, powers of 2-10, ending in 1-9) and every
interval of 1-100. The rules share a prior fraction lambda equally; the
intervals share the rest by an Erlang density on their size (scale sigma).
Examples are sampled from the concept (the size principle), 10% of them
uniformly from 1-100, and "yes" is the posterior probability that the
concept contains the target.

## exemplar_feature_similarity_gcm  — no comparison row

People do not entertain explicit rules; they judge the target by its summed psychological similarity to the remembered examples (an exemplar / generalized-context model). Similarity decays exponentially with distance in a feature space where each number is described by its magnitude and by its surface properties (parity, last digit, tens digit, divisibility by 3/4/5, being prime or a square), with attention split between magnitude and properties; the more similar the target is to the examples on average, the more likely a "yes".

## weak_sampling_concept_generalization  — no comparison row

People entertain the same mathematical rules and numeric ranges as candidate concepts, but treat the examples only as labelled members of the concept rather than as random draws from it (weak sampling, no size principle): every concept consistent with the examples stays credible in proportion to its prior, however broad it is, so adding examples rules concepts out but never sharpens generalization toward the narrowest one. The sharpest disagreement with the best (strong-sampling) model is on multi-example sets that fit both a narrow rule and broader ones (e.g. 16,8,64 or 83,38,58,68): this model predicts broad, graded "yes" to targets in wide consistent ranges and broad rules, where the size-principle model predicts confident yes only for the narrow rule.

## digit_feature_exemplar_similarity  — no comparison row

People judge a target by its featural resemblance to the examples in decimal notation: each example's similarity to the target falls off exponentially with whether the two differ in their ones digit and whether they differ in their tens digit, and the probability of saying yes grows with the target's summed (averaged) similarity to the shown examples, as in an exemplar model over digit features rather than a search over explicit rules.

## concept_learning_with_guess_lapse  — no comparison row

Refinement of `bigelow_piantadosi_independent`: people do Bayesian concept learning over the same 45 rules with separately weighted priors plus every interval of 1-100 (size principle, 10% of examples random), but on a fixed fraction of trials they do not consult the inferred concept at all and instead answer by guessing, saying "yes" at their own baseline rate. The one change is this response-lapse component, which lets the model explain "no" answers to targets the concept clearly contains (even the shown examples) and stray "yes" answers to targets it clearly excludes.
