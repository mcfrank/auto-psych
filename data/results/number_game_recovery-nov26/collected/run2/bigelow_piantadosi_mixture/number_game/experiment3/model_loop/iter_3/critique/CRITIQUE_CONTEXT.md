# The task

Each participant sees a few example numbers between 1 and 100, produced by a
hidden computer program, and is asked about other numbers between 1 and 100:
would the program also produce this number? The examples on a trial are its
*set* (one to four numbers, shown in the order given); the number asked about
is the *target*. The participant answers yes or no. There is no correct
answer and no feedback.

Every participant answers about many (set, target) pairs, and the same set is
asked about with many targets.

## The data

Each row of `responses.csv` is one answer:

| Column           | Meaning                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `number_set`     | the example numbers, comma-separated in the order shown ("16,8,64") |
| `target`         | the number asked about, 1-100                                      |
| `rating`         | 1 if the participant answered yes (the program would produce it), else 0 |
| `trial_index`    | the trial's position in that participant's session                 |

## Your job

**Incumbent (best) model:** `heading_weber_upward_with_replacement`
**Incumbent model code:** `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/models/heading_weber_upward_with_replacement.py`
**Incumbent hypothesis:** Refinement of the incumbent `heading_weber_with_upward_counting`: people do Bayesian concept learning over the same arithmetic, digit and digit-sum rules and every numeric range of 1-100. They allow some strays, sometimes guess, judge a range's breadth Weber-like, let the last step's direction stretch ranges toward where the sequence is heading, and expect the program's numbers to carry on upward past the largest example. The one change is the sampling assumption. People do not assume the program avoids repeating itself, so they read each example as an independent draw from the concept's members (with replacement), not as a draw from the members not yet shown. This predicts that examples that nearly use up a small rule or a short range (e.g. 1, 8, 27 for cubes, or 60, 61, 62, 63 for a four-number stretch) make that concept no more credible than the plain size principle implies, so people say "yes" more often to members of broader rules and ranges after such sets than the incumbent predicts.

**Responses CSV:** `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/responses.csv`
**Columns (DataFrame your test statistics receive):** `number_set,target,trial_index,rating`
**Model set directory:** `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/models`

Propose **8** test statistics. Write each to `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_3/critique/test_stats/<name>.py` as a function `test_statistic(df)` returning a scalar, with `# name:` and `# description:` header comments.

You do **not** need to run anything. After you write the statistics, the pipeline runs the posterior-predictive harness automatically over `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_3/critique/test_stats` and records the results:

```bash
python3 -m src.critique.ppc \
    --responses /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/responses.csv \
    --model heading_weber_upward_with_replacement \
    --models-dir /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/models \
    --test-stats-dir /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_3/critique/test_stats \
    --out /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_3/critique/ppc_results.json \
    --cache-dir /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/mcmc_cache \
    --n-replicates 1000 \
    --significance-alpha 0.05
```

That writes `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_3/critique/ppc_results.json` with a two-sided empirical p-value per statistic (1000 posterior-predictive replicates). A statistic is a **significant discrepancy** when its `p_value` ≤ 0.05 (raw, no multiple-comparisons correction).

Each statistic is called 1001 times (the observed data, then every replicate). Each call must finish within 5 s and all of them within 300 s (about 0.3 s per call), so vectorise it: no row-wise `apply` and no Python loops over rows. A statistic that raises or runs out of time gets no p-value.
