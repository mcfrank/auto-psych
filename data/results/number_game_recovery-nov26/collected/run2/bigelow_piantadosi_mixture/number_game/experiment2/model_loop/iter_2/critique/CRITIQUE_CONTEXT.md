# The task

Each participant sees a few example numbers between 1 and 100, produced by a
hidden computer program, and is asked about other numbers between 1 and 100:
would the program also produce this number? The examples on a trial are its
*set* (one to four numbers, shown in the order given); the number asked about
is the *target*. The participant answers yes or no. There is no correct
answer and no feedback.

Every participant answers about many (set, target) pairs, and the same set is
asked about with many targets.

## The data

Each row of `responses.csv` is one answer:

| Column           | Meaning                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `number_set`     | the example numbers, comma-separated in the order shown ("16,8,64") |
| `target`         | the number asked about, 1-100                                      |
| `rating`         | 1 if the participant answered yes (the program would produce it), else 0 |
| `trial_index`    | the trial's position in that participant's session                 |

## Your job

**Incumbent (best) model:** `digit_sum_concepts`
**Incumbent model code:** `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/models/digit_sum_concepts.py`
**Incumbent hypothesis:** People do Bayesian concept learning over the same arithmetic and digit rules and numeric ranges as the best model: distinct examples drawn without replacement, some strays, occasional guessing, and a prior that favours narrow ranges. They also read the numbers as written numerals and entertain one more kind of concept, "numbers whose digits add up to s" (for example 18, 27, 36, 45 or 13, 22, 31, 40). All 18 such digit-sum concepts are equally likely a priori, and the family as a whole takes an inferred share of the prior belief given to rules. This predicts that examples sharing a digit sum (e.g. 36, 45, 54, 81) lead to "yes" for other numbers with the same digit sum, such as 63, 72, 90 or 27, beyond what "multiples of 9" or a range gives, and to fewer "yes" answers for other members of those broader concepts.

**Responses CSV:** `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/responses.csv`
**Columns (DataFrame your test statistics receive):** `number_set,target,trial_index,rating`
**Model set directory:** `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/models`

Propose **8** test statistics. Write each to `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/iter_2/critique/test_stats/<name>.py` as a function `test_statistic(df)` returning a scalar, with `# name:` and `# description:` header comments.

You do **not** need to run anything. After you write the statistics, the pipeline runs the posterior-predictive harness automatically over `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/iter_2/critique/test_stats` and records the results:

```bash
python3 -m src.critique.ppc \
    --responses /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/responses.csv \
    --model digit_sum_concepts \
    --models-dir /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/models \
    --test-stats-dir /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/iter_2/critique/test_stats \
    --out /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/iter_2/critique/ppc_results.json \
    --cache-dir /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/mcmc_cache \
    --n-replicates 1000 \
    --significance-alpha 0.05
```

That writes `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/88c1bd3cf1e5f7a8/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/iter_2/critique/ppc_results.json` with a two-sided empirical p-value per statistic (1000 posterior-predictive replicates). A statistic is a **significant discrepancy** when its `p_value` ≤ 0.05 (raw, no multiple-comparisons correction).

Each statistic is called 1001 times (the observed data, then every replicate). Each call must finish within 5 s and all of them within 300 s (about 0.3 s per call), so vectorise it: no row-wise `apply` and no Python loops over rows. A statistic that raises or runs out of time gets no p-value.
