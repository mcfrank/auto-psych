# The task

Each participant sees a few example numbers between 1 and 100, produced by a
hidden computer program, and is asked about other numbers between 1 and 100:
would the program also produce this number? The examples on a trial are its
*set* (one to four numbers, shown in the order given); the number asked about
is the *target*. The participant answers yes or no. There is no correct
answer and no feedback.

Every participant answers about many (set, target) pairs, and the same set is
asked about with many targets.

## The data

Each row of `responses.csv` is one answer:

| Column           | Meaning                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `number_set`     | the example numbers, comma-separated in the order shown ("16,8,64") |
| `target`         | the number asked about, 1-100                                      |
| `rating`         | 1 if the participant answered yes (the program would produce it), else 0 |
| `trial_index`    | the trial's position in that participant's session                 |

## Your job

**Incumbent (best) model:** `loose_range_sampling_sparse_rules`
**Incumbent model code:** `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/models/loose_range_sampling_sparse_rules.py`
**Incumbent hypothesis:** Refinement of `sparse_rule_familiarity_within_kinds`: people do the same capacity-limited Bayesian learning over rules (with sparse familiarity within each kind) and numerical ranges. The single change is that people do not apply the size principle equally to both kinds of explanation: they read the examples with one sampling strength when weighing arithmetic rules and with a separate, looser one when weighing stretches of the number line, so the examples count for less as evidence that a range is tight. This predicts that sets no rule fits are generalized somewhat beyond the examples' span, and that as examples accumulate, a fitting rule overtakes the tightest covering range faster than a single shared sampling strength allows.

**Responses CSV:** `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/responses.csv`
**Columns (DataFrame your test statistics receive):** `number_set,target,trial_index,rating`
**Model set directory:** `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/models`

Propose **8** test statistics. Write each to `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_1/critique/test_stats/<name>.py` as a function `test_statistic(df)` returning a scalar, with `# name:` and `# description:` header comments.

You do **not** need to run anything. After you write the statistics, the pipeline runs the posterior-predictive harness automatically over `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_1/critique/test_stats` and records the results:

```bash
python3 -m src.critique.ppc \
    --responses /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/responses.csv \
    --model loose_range_sampling_sparse_rules \
    --models-dir /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/models \
    --test-stats-dir /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_1/critique/test_stats \
    --out /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_1/critique/ppc_results.json \
    --cache-dir /scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/mcmc_cache \
    --n-replicates 1000 \
    --significance-alpha 0.05
```

That writes `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/fc3d1e4e3afb1c37/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment3/model_loop/iter_1/critique/ppc_results.json` with a two-sided empirical p-value per statistic (1000 posterior-predictive replicates). A statistic is a **significant discrepancy** when its `p_value` ≤ 0.05 (raw, no multiple-comparisons correction).

Each statistic is called 1001 times (the observed data, then every replicate). Each call must finish within 5 s and all of them within 300 s (about 0.3 s per call), so vectorise it: no row-wise `apply` and no Python loops over rows. A statistic that raises or runs out of time gets no p-value.
