# Candidate Brief

Refine the incumbent: `multiplicative_not_exponential_concepts` — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -840.1. Its hypothesis, as its author stated it:

> People's concept space for numbers is built on multiplication, not exponentiation: they readily entertain parity, "multiples of m", final digits, digits contained and numerical ranges, but concepts that require repeated multiplication — powers of a base, perfect squares, perfect cubes — are a priori much less accessible, carrying a fitted extra cost on top of the ordinary per-primitive simplicity cost, size principle and near-all-or-none commitment. So after 32, 4, 16 or 4, 64 people generalise to other multiples of 4 (12, 72) rather than restricting themselves to powers of 2 or 4, extending shared-divisor rules more than a learner who finds powers as natural as multiples.

Its source is `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/d6b6238b22d937a5/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment1/model_loop/models/multiplicative_not_exponential_concepts.py`. Read it before you write anything.

Produce the version of this model you believe would beat it on the current data: keep the mechanism that makes it win and change what it gets wrong — a different functional form, prior or normalisation of its mechanism, a cue it ignores, or a component taken from another model in `refinement_menu.md`. For this slot the rule against grafting cues from other models onto a hypothesis is lifted, and so is the rule against composing mechanisms: you may add a component from another model. Two things still hold: make **one** deliberate, stated change (a grab-bag of cues added to fit better is not a refinement), and change something that matters — the novelty gate rejects a candidate whose predictions match a live model's across the stimulus space, the incumbent's included.

Say in `hypothesis.md` which model you refined and what you changed: that is part of the claim.

If `critiques.md` is present, prioritise a hypothesis that addresses one of the significant discrepancies it reports.
