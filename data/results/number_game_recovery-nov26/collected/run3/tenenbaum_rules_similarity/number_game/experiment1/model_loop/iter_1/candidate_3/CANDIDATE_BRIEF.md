# Candidate Brief

Refine the incumbent: `rule_family_prior_concepts` — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -1085.1. Its hypothesis, as its author stated it:

> Refinement of `bigelow_piantadosi_mixture`: people do Bayesian concept learning over the same 45 rules and all intervals (size principle, 10% of examples random), but their prior over rules is organised by kind of rule rather than flat: they first favour a family of rule (parity, primes, squares/cubes, powers, multiples, last digit, contained digit), each with its own inferred plausibility, and rules within a family are equally likely. The one change is replacing the mixture's uniform rule prior with this inferred family-level prior, so whole kinds of rule (e.g. "contains the digit d") can be a priori implausible while others (multiples, last digit) dominate generalization.

Its source is `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/570a40651ab1ca31/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment1/model_loop/models/rule_family_prior_concepts.py`. Read it before you write anything.

Produce the version of this model you believe would beat it on the current data: keep the mechanism that makes it win and change what it gets wrong — a different functional form, prior or normalisation of its mechanism, a cue it ignores, or a component taken from another model in `refinement_menu.md`. For this slot the rule against grafting cues from other models onto a hypothesis is lifted, and so is the rule against composing mechanisms: you may add a component from another model. Two things still hold: make **one** deliberate, stated change (a grab-bag of cues added to fit better is not a refinement), and change something that matters — the novelty gate rejects a candidate whose predictions match a live model's across the stimulus space, the incumbent's included.

Say in `hypothesis.md` which model you refined and what you changed: that is part of the claim.

If `critiques.md` is present, prioritise a hypothesis that addresses one of the significant discrepancies it reports.
