# Candidate Brief

Refine the incumbent: `coincidence_sharpened_exemplar` — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -2761.6. Its hypothesis, as its author stated it:

> People generalize from the examples by summed similarity (magnitude, final digit, parity, shared factors), but how sharply similarity falls off is set by how suspicious a coincidence the examples are: the less likely it is that the examples would share their most specific common property (all the same final digit, all multiples of 5, all the same parity) by chance, the more specific they take the program to be. So they tighten their generalization on every dimension at once. This disagrees most with the best model on coherent sets, e.g. "78, 48, 88" or "15, 85, 45" (near non-matching targets rejected far more), "90, 45" (multiples of 5 favoured more sharply), and on how much sets differ in overall endorsement, while single examples and incoherent sets are generalized as before.

Its source is `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/d82b8b9c1e886668/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment2/model_loop/models/coincidence_sharpened_exemplar.py`. Read it before you write anything.

Produce the version of this model you believe would beat it on the current data: keep the mechanism that makes it win and change what it gets wrong — a different functional form, prior or normalisation of its mechanism, a cue it ignores, or a component taken from another model in `refinement_menu.md`. For this slot the rule against grafting cues from other models onto a hypothesis is lifted, and so is the rule against composing mechanisms: you may add a component from another model. Two things still hold: make **one** deliberate, stated change (a grab-bag of cues added to fit better is not a refinement), and change something that matters — the novelty gate rejects a candidate whose predictions match a live model's across the stimulus space, the incumbent's included.

Say in `hypothesis.md` which model you refined and what you changed: that is part of the claim.

If `critiques.md` is present, prioritise a hypothesis that addresses one of the significant discrepancies it reports.
