# Existing hypotheses

Each model below is ONE cognitive hypothesis, with how it stands on the current data by ELPD-LOO (best first). `elpd_diff ± dse` is a model's deficit against the best and the standard error of that difference (with the responses to each stimulus pair counted together, as they are correlated): within about 2·dse the two are statistically tied on this data; beyond it the model has lost. "PSIS-LOO unreliable" means the estimate itself is untrustworthy (too many high-Pareto-k trials), not that the model is bad. Propose a hypothesis that is genuinely different from these, or a refinement of a single one of them — never a combination of several.

## iter0_candidate3  — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -1023.0

Refinement of `local_representativeness`: people judge randomness by the same Kahneman & Tversky local-representativeness score (multiscale local balance plus irregularity relative to an over-alternating prototype and periodic templates), but they differ in how decisively they apply it. The single change is that the decision sensitivity (beta) is person-specific, drawn from a population distribution, rather than shared by everyone — addressing the critique that people differ in agreement with the majority far more than one pooled sensitivity allows.

## iter0_candidate4  — rank 1, 0.4 ± 0.5 nats behind the best (0.7× dse: statistically tied with the best), ELPD-LOO -1023.4

Refinement of `local_representativeness` (Kahneman & Tversky's local representativeness: a sequence looks random to the extent it is locally balanced at several window scales and irregular, i.e. somewhat over-alternating but not periodic). The one change: people share this representativeness criterion but differ in how consistently they apply it, so each participant has their own decision sensitivity (drawn from a population distribution) rather than one shared sensitivity — addressing the critique that participants differ in agreement with the majority far more than a single pooled sensitivity allows.

## recency_weighted_gamblers_surprise  — rank 2, 12.4 ± 12.8 nats behind the best (1.0× dse: statistically tied with the best), ELPD-LOO -1035.4; PSIS-LOO unreliable (2% of trials with a high Pareto k) — its ELPD is untrustworthy

People judge randomness by reading each sequence flip by flip while predicting the next flip with a gambler's-fallacy expectation — the longer the current run, the more they expect it to break — and a sequence looks random to the extent its flips were unsurprising under that expectation. Their memory of the surprise fades, so surprises near the end of the sequence (such as a final repeat that extends a run) weigh more than early ones; people differ in how strongly this felt surprise drives their choice.

## gamblers_fallacy_leaky_predictor  — rank 3, 12.9 ± 11.5 nats behind the best (1.1× dse: statistically tied with the best), ELPD-LOO -1035.9; PSIS-LOO unreliable (1% of trials with a high Pareto k) — its ELPD is untrustworthy

People judge randomness by running a gambler's-fallacy predictor through the sequence: before each flip they expect the coin to "correct" the heads/tails imbalance seen so far, with recent flips weighing more than older ones in that leaky running tally, and a sequence looks random to the extent its flips match those corrective expectations (high average predictive probability). Unlike the incumbent's position-blind balance and alternation summaries, this makes the *order* of flips matter — a terminal repeat or a late streak (which violates a strong, just-built expectation of reversal) is penalised far more than the same repeat early on — so the two models disagree most on equal-composition pairs that differ only in where a repeat or run sits, especially at the end; people also differ in how sharply they apply this judgment.

## streak_tolerance_alarm  — rank 4, 46.9 ± 20.9 nats behind the best (2.3× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1069.9; PSIS-LOO unreliable (4% of trials with a high Pareto k) — its ELPD is untrustworthy

People judge randomness with a streak alarm: there is a tolerance for how long a run of identical flips may be before it "looks too long to be chance", and every run in a sequence that exceeds that tolerance raises the alarm, more so the further it exceeds it, while runs within the tolerance cost nothing. The sequence raising the smaller alarm is chosen as more random, and people differ in how strongly the alarm drives their choice.

## motif_stack_person_sensitivity  — rank 5, 64.9 ± 20.4 nats behind the best (3.2× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1087.9

Refinement of `motif_stack`: people judge a sequence random to the extent it is poorly explained by the Griffiths et al. (2018) four-motif stack automaton (mirror, complement and duplication production methods) relative to a fair coin, exactly as in `motif_stack` — but each person applies that shared regularity-detection process with their own decisiveness. The single change is that the sensitivity mapping the randomness-score difference to choice varies across participants (a hierarchical, log-normal population of per-person sensitivities) instead of being one shared value, addressing the critique that people differ in how consistently they agree with the majority judgment far more than a single pooled sensitivity allows.

## local_representativeness  — rank 6, 236.9 ± 25.1 nats behind the best (9.4× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1259.9

A quantitative operationalization of Kahneman & Tversky (1972): local
balance is averaged across the whole sequence and sliding-window scales
2--4, while irregularity combines an over-alternating prototype with a
periodic-template penalty. This is theory-inspired because K&T did not
publish a unique quantitative scoring equation.

## motif_stack  — rank 7, 279.5 ± 28.0 nats behind the best (10.0× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1302.5

Randomness = log-likelihood ratio of a fair coin versus Griffiths et
al. (2018)'s four-motif stack automaton: a row-normalised six-state
motif process augmented with mirror symmetry, complement symmetry, and
duplication production methods, using the paper's max-path/max-method
definition. Comparisons are restricted to equal-length sequences.

## falk_konold_dp  — rank 8, 513.3 ± 36.2 nats behind the best (14.2× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1536.3

Sequences seem random to the extent they are hard to encode mentally:
randomness = the Difficulty Predictor DP = pure runs + 2*alternating
runs under the DP-minimising parse, unnormalised by length (Falk &
Konold 1997, p. 308). No free cognitive parameters.

## finite_experience_occurrence  — rank 9, 714.6 ± 69.3 nats behind the best (10.3× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1737.6

A string seems random to the extent one actually encounters it when
watching a fair coin for the paper's focal finite stretch: randomness =
log probability of occurring at least once in 20 flips (Hahn & Warren
2009). Comparisons are restricted to equal-length sequences. Penalises
long runs and perfect alternation without fitted cognitive parameters.

## adaptive_transition_learner_surprise  — no comparison row

People judge randomness by reading each sequence flip by flip while an online pattern learner tries to predict whether the next flip will repeat or switch, starting from a prior expectation (which may favour switching) and updating that expectation from the transitions seen so far. A sequence looks random to the extent this learner keeps being surprised — so sequences whose transitions become predictable as you read them (long streaks, but also perfect alternation once it has been seen a few times) look less random — and people differ in how decisively this felt unpredictability drives their choice.

## bayesian_overalternating_chance_model  — no comparison row

People judge randomness as Bayesian inference: a sequence looks random to the extent a fair coin explains it better than a "regular" generator (a coin with an unknown tendency to switch or repeat, or a coin with an unknown bias towards heads or tails), with the regular generators' unknown rates averaged out normatively. The one distortion is in their model of chance itself: people believe a fair coin switches sides more often than half the time, so their "random" likelihood rewards alternation and penalises repeats by a fitted amount — which also sets how much a perfectly alternating sequence is still credited as random rather than condemned as regular.

## ideal_switch_rate_prototype  — no comparison row

People judge randomness by a single gist cue: how often the sequence switches between heads and tails. They hold an internal ideal switch rate (a fair coin's "should look like" rate, which may be above one half), and a sequence looks random to the extent its switch rate is close to that ideal — too few switches (long streaks) and too many switches (perfect alternation) both make it look less random. People differ in how decisively this one cue drives their choice.

## asymmetric_alternation_representativeness  — no comparison row

Refinement of the incumbent `iter0_candidate3` (Kahneman & Tversky local representativeness with person-specific sensitivity): people judge randomness by the same score — multiscale local balance plus irregularity relative to an over-alternating prototype and periodic templates — but the deviation from their prototype alternation rate is felt asymmetrically. The single change: too few alternations (streaky, repetitive sequences) look strongly non-random, whereas too many alternations (up to perfect HTHT alternation) are penalised only by a fitted fraction of that slope, because over-alternation is what people expect of chance; this addresses the critique that the incumbent over-penalises perfectly alternating sequences.

## iter1_candidate4  — no comparison row

Refinement of the incumbent `iter0_candidate3` (Kahneman & Tversky local representativeness with person-specific decision sensitivity): people judge randomness by the same multiscale local balance plus irregularity score, but their sense of "periodic pattern" only picks up repeating templates longer than two flips (e.g. HHT-HHT, HHTT-HHTT); streaks (period 1) and plain alternation (period 2) are judged only through the balance and alternation-rate cues, not penalised a second time as periodic patterns. The single change is this non-redundant periodicity penalty, addressing the critique that the incumbent over-penalises perfect alternation (and, more weakly, long streaks) relative to what people choose.
