# Critique context

# The task

Each participant takes part in one experiment. On every trial they see two
sequences of coin flips, written as strings of H (heads) and T (tails), side by
side. The two sequences always have the same length, between 2 and 8 flips;
lengths vary from trial to trial. The participant chooses the one sequence that
looks more random to them. There is no correct answer and no feedback.

Before the first trial, participants read these instructions:

> In this study, you will look at sequences of coin flips and judge how
> random they look.
>
> Imagine flipping a fair coin over and over. Each flip is equally likely to
> come up Heads (H) or Tails (T), and every flip is independent — the coin has
> no memory, so what came before does not change what comes next.
>
> On each trial you will see two sequences of coin flips, side by side. The two
> sequences will have the same length. Your task is to pick the one sequence
> that looks more random to you — the one that looks more like it was produced
> by genuinely random coin flipping.
>
> Different people have different impressions of what makes a sequence look
> random, and there are no right or wrong answers. We are interested in your
> own honest impression, so go with your gut.

Each trial asks "Which sequence looks more random?" and the participant clicks
`Left` or `Right`. Which sequence of a pair is shown on the left is randomised.

## The data

Each row of `responses.csv` is one choice:

| Column           | Meaning                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sequence_a`     | the sequence shown on the left                                  |
| `sequence_b`     | the sequence shown on the right                                 |
| `chose_left`     | 1 if the participant chose the left sequence as more random, else 0 |
| `participant_id` | the participant; unique across experiments                      |
| `trial_index`    | the trial's position in that participant's session              |

Every participant in an experiment sees the same set of pairs.

## Your job

**Incumbent (best) model:** `length_normalised_chance_vs_motif`
**Incumbent model code:** `/scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/models/length_normalised_chance_vs_motif.py`
**Incumbent hypothesis:** Refinement of the incumbent `bayesian_chance_vs_repeating_motif_2`: people still judge a sequence random to the extent their (over-alternating) model of a fair coin explains it better than the regular generators (a switch-biased Markov coin, a biased coin, and a repeating short motif with occasional slips), with the generators' unknowns averaged out. The single change is in how that evidence is weighed: people judge the evidence per flip rather than in total, so the log evidence difference is divided by a fitted power of the sequence length — the same per-flip regularity is judged about as decisively in a short pair as in a long one, instead of long sequences automatically yielding near-certain choices — addressing the critique that people are more decisive on short pairs (relative to long) than the incumbent predicts and that it over-penalises long perfect alternation.

**Responses CSV:** `/scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/responses.csv`
**Columns (DataFrame your test statistics receive):** `sequence_a,sequence_b,participant_id,trial_index,chose_left`
**Model set directory:** `/scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/models`

Propose **8** test statistics. Write each to `/scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/iter_4/critique/test_stats/<name>.py` as a function `test_statistic(df)` returning a scalar, with `# name:` and `# description:` header comments.

You do **not** need to run anything. After you write the statistics, the pipeline runs the posterior-predictive harness automatically over `/scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/iter_4/critique/test_stats` and records the results:

```bash
python3 -m src.critique.ppc \
    --responses /scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/responses.csv \
    --model length_normalised_chance_vs_motif \
    --models-dir /scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/models \
    --test-stats-dir /scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/iter_4/critique/test_stats \
    --out /scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/iter_4/critique/ppc_results.json \
    --cache-dir /scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/.fit_cache \
    --n-replicates 1000 \
    --significance-alpha 0.05
```

That writes `/scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run3/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/iter_4/critique/ppc_results.json` with a two-sided empirical p-value per statistic (1000 posterior-predictive replicates). A statistic is a **significant discrepancy** when its `p_value` ≤ 0.05 (raw, no multiple-comparisons correction).

Each statistic is called 1001 times (the observed data, then every replicate). Each call must finish within 5 s and all of them within 300 s (about 0.3 s per call), so vectorise it: no row-wise `apply` and no Python loops over rows. A statistic that raises or runs out of time gets no p-value.
