# Refinement menu

The models you may refine, other than the incumbent `local_representativeness`. Each entry is one mechanism: its hypothesis in full as its author stated it, how it stands, and where its source is. This is a menu, not a list of what is ruled out: a pruned model lost to the best model on the data it was scored on, by the stated margin, but its mechanism may be partly right — and a model that lost narrowly is the most promising target here. Read the source of the model you pick before you write anything.

## Live models other than the incumbent (in the set; best first)

### motif_stack — rank 1, 18.1 ± 13.9 nats behind the best (1.3× dse: statistically tied with the best), ELPD-LOO -1416.5

**Hypothesis:** Randomness = log-likelihood ratio of a fair coin versus Griffiths et al. (2018)'s four-motif stack automaton: a row-normalised six-state motif process augmented with mirror symmetry, complement symmetry, and duplication production methods, using the paper's max-path/max-method definition. Comparisons are restricted to equal-length sequences.

### falk_konold_dp — rank 2, 181.0 ± 25.8 nats behind the best (7.0× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1579.4

**Hypothesis:** Sequences seem random to the extent they are hard to encode mentally: randomness = the Difficulty Predictor DP = pure runs + 2*alternating runs under the DP-minimising parse, unnormalised by length (Falk & Konold 1997, p. 308). No free cognitive parameters.

**Source:** `/scratch/users/kushinm/auto-psych/outer_loop_live/run1/data/subjective_randomness/experiment1/model_loop/models/falk_konold_dp.py`

### finite_experience_occurrence — rank 3, 349.8 ± 42.2 nats behind the best (8.3× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1748.3

**Hypothesis:** A string seems random to the extent one actually encounters it when watching a fair coin for the paper's focal finite stretch: randomness = log probability of occurring at least once in 20 flips (Hahn & Warren 2009). Comparisons are restricted to equal-length sequences. Penalises long runs and perfect alternation without fitted cognitive parameters.

### personal_switch_belief — no comparison row

**Hypothesis:** Each person carries their own subjective model of a fair coin as a process that switches between heads and tails with a personal probability (some believe coins alternate far more than half the time, others near or below half), and judges as more random whichever sequence is more probable under that personal switching belief. Because the believed switch rate differs from person to person, the same pair can be judged in opposite directions by different participants: strong alternation-lovers pick the more alternating sequence, others pick the streakier one.

### personal_ideal_alternation — no comparison row

**Hypothesis:** Each person carries their own ideal switching rate for a random coin (how often consecutive flips should differ), and judges a sequence as more random the closer its proportion of alternations lies to that personal ideal; these ideals differ between people, some expecting near-perfect alternation and others streakier sequences. The model disagrees most with the current best model on highly alternating sequences (e.g. HTHTHTHT versus a streaky sequence), where it predicts a population split — some people strongly prefer them, others strongly reject them — and on pairs that differ in balance but not in alternation rate, where it predicts indifference.

### individual_alternation_prototype — no comparison row

**Hypothesis:** Refinement of the incumbent `local_representativeness` (Kahneman & Tversky's local representativeness: a sequence looks random when it is locally balanced and irregular, i.e. close to a prototype alternation rate and not periodic). The one change: each person holds their own prototype alternation rate — some expect a random sequence to switch much more often than a fair coin does, others barely more or even less — drawn from a population distribution, instead of everyone sharing one prototype. This addresses the critique that people differ far more in how strongly they prefer the more-alternating sequence than a single-population model produces.
