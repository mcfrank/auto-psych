# Existing hypotheses

Each model below is ONE cognitive hypothesis, with how it stands on the current data by ELPD-LOO (best first). `elpd_diff ± dse` is a model's deficit against the best and the standard error of that difference (with the responses to each stimulus pair counted together, as they are correlated): within about 2·dse the two are statistically tied on this data; beyond it the model has lost. "PSIS-LOO unreliable" means the estimate itself is untrustworthy (too many high-Pareto-k trials), not that the model is bad. Propose a hypothesis that is genuinely different from these, or a refinement of a single one of them — never a combination of several.

## local_representativeness  — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -1380.4

A quantitative operationalization of Kahneman & Tversky (1972): local
balance is averaged across the whole sequence and sliding-window scales
2--4, while irregularity combines an over-alternating prototype with a
periodic-template penalty. This is theory-inspired because K&T did not
publish a unique quantitative scoring equation.

## motif_stack  — rank 1, 47.0 ± 21.6 nats behind the best (2.2× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1427.4

Randomness = log-likelihood ratio of a fair coin versus Griffiths et
al. (2018)'s four-motif stack automaton: a row-normalised six-state
motif process augmented with mirror symmetry, complement symmetry, and
duplication production methods, using the paper's max-path/max-method
definition. Comparisons are restricted to equal-length sequences.

## falk_konold_dp  — rank 2, 184.1 ± 28.5 nats behind the best (6.5× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1564.5

Sequences seem random to the extent they are hard to encode mentally:
randomness = the Difficulty Predictor DP = pure runs + 2*alternating
runs under the DP-minimising parse, unnormalised by length (Falk &
Konold 1997, p. 308). No free cognitive parameters.

## finite_experience_occurrence  — rank 3, 322.8 ± 47.6 nats behind the best (6.8× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1703.2

A string seems random to the extent one actually encounters it when
watching a fair coin for the paper's focal finite stretch: randomness =
log probability of occurring at least once in 20 flips (Hahn & Warren
2009). Comparisons are restricted to equal-length sequences. Penalises
long runs and perfect alternation without fitted cognitive parameters.

## personal_markov_coin_belief  — no comparison row

Each person carries their own subjective model of what a fair coin does: a belief about how often a random coin switches between H and T from one flip to the next (many believe it switches more than half the time, some less). They judge which sequence is more random by how probable each sequence would be under their own believed coin, choosing between the two in proportion to those probabilities, so people differ systematically in how strongly — and in which direction — alternation makes a sequence look random.

## personal_alternation_ideal  — no comparison row

Each person carries their own ideal switching rate for a random coin — some expect a fair coin to flip side about half the time, others expect it to alternate far more often — and judges a sequence as random to the extent that its proportion of H/T switches is close to that personal ideal. The current best model assumes one shared alternation prototype for everyone; this model disagrees most sharply on pairs where both sequences alternate heavily (e.g. HTHTHTHT versus HTHHTHTH), which strong over-alternators should split decisively toward the more alternating sequence while moderate people choose the other.

## person_alternation_prototype  — no comparison row

Refinement of the incumbent `local_representativeness` (Kahneman & Tversky local representativeness: a sequence looks random when it is locally balanced and irregular, irregularity being closeness to an over-alternating prototype plus a periodic-template penalty). The one change: each person carries their own ideal alternation rate (prototype), drawn from a population distribution, rather than everyone sharing a single prototype — so people differ in how much alternation they expect from a random coin, which the single-population incumbent cannot produce (the critique's large across-participant spread in preference for the more-alternating sequence).

## person_specific_alternation_prototype  — no comparison row

Refinement of `local_representativeness` (Kahneman & Tversky local representativeness): people judge randomness by local H/T balance across scales plus irregularity measured as distance from a preferred alternation rate and a periodic-template penalty, but each person holds their own preferred alternation rate (prototype) rather than one shared by everyone. The single change is making the alternation prototype person-specific, drawn from a population distribution, which addresses the critique that the model under-produces individual differences in preference for alternation.
