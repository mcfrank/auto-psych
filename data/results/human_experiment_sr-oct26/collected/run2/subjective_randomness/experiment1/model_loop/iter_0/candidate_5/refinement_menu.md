# Refinement menu

The models you may refine, other than the incumbent `local_representativeness`. Each entry is one mechanism: its hypothesis in full as its author stated it, how it stands, and where its source is. This is a menu, not a list of what is ruled out: a pruned model lost to the best model on the data it was scored on, by the stated margin, but its mechanism may be partly right — and a model that lost narrowly is the most promising target here. Read the source of the model you pick before you write anything.

## Live models other than the incumbent (in the set; best first)

### motif_stack — rank 1, 47.0 ± 21.6 nats behind the best (2.2× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1427.4

**Hypothesis:** Randomness = log-likelihood ratio of a fair coin versus Griffiths et al. (2018)'s four-motif stack automaton: a row-normalised six-state motif process augmented with mirror symmetry, complement symmetry, and duplication production methods, using the paper's max-path/max-method definition. Comparisons are restricted to equal-length sequences.

### falk_konold_dp — rank 2, 184.1 ± 28.5 nats behind the best (6.5× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1564.5

**Hypothesis:** Sequences seem random to the extent they are hard to encode mentally: randomness = the Difficulty Predictor DP = pure runs + 2*alternating runs under the DP-minimising parse, unnormalised by length (Falk & Konold 1997, p. 308). No free cognitive parameters.

### finite_experience_occurrence — rank 3, 322.8 ± 47.6 nats behind the best (6.8× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1703.2

**Hypothesis:** A string seems random to the extent one actually encounters it when watching a fair coin for the paper's focal finite stretch: randomness = log probability of occurring at least once in 20 flips (Hahn & Warren 2009). Comparisons are restricted to equal-length sequences. Penalises long runs and perfect alternation without fitted cognitive parameters.
