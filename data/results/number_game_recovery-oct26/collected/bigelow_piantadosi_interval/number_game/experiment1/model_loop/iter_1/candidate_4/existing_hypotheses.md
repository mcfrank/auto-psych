# Existing hypotheses

Each model below is ONE cognitive hypothesis, with how it stands on the current data by ELPD-LOO (best first). `elpd_diff ± dse` is a model's deficit against the best and the standard error of that difference (with the responses to each stimulus pair counted together, as they are correlated): within about 2·dse the two are statistically tied on this data; beyond it the model has lost. "PSIS-LOO unreliable" means the estimate itself is untrustworthy (too many high-Pareto-k trials), not that the model is bad. Propose a hypothesis that is genuinely different from these, or a refinement of a single one of them — never a combination of several.

## concept_learning_with_guessing  — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -830.8

Refinement of bigelow_piantadosi_independent: people do the same Bayesian concept learning over 42 weighted rules and all intervals (size principle, 10% noisy examples), but on a fraction of trials they do not consult the inferred concept at all and instead guess, answering "yes" with their own guessing bias. The one change is this inferred guessing (lapse) rate with a yes-bias, which puts a floor under "yes" for targets far outside every plausible concept (the far-outside-range yeses the incumbent under-produces) and a ceiling below 1 for the examples themselves.

## bigelow_piantadosi_independent  — rank 1, 5.0 ± 5.6 nats behind the best (0.9× dse: statistically tied with the best), ELPD-LOO -835.8

Bayesian concept learning over 42 rules (powers of 2-10, multiples of
3-12, final digit 1-9, contained digit 1-9, primes, even, odd, squares,
cubes) and every interval of 1-100, with a prior weight inferred for each
rule separately and a share p_mix for the rules as a group; intervals are
equally likely. Examples are sampled from the concept (the size
principle), 10% of them uniformly from 1-100, and "yes" is the posterior
probability that the concept contains the target.

## interval_width_power_prior  — rank 2, 7.4 ± 6.5 nats behind the best (1.1× dse: statistically tied with the best), ELPD-LOO -838.2

Refinement of bigelow_piantadosi_independent: people still do Bayesian concept learning over the same 42 weighted rules and all intervals of 1-100 with the size principle, but their prior over intervals is not flat — it rises or falls as a power of the interval's width, with the exponent inferred. A prior that favours wide intervals offsets the size principle and makes people generalize further beyond the range of the examples (the incumbent under-produces "yes" to targets far outside that range); an exponent of zero recovers the incumbent.

## tempered_size_principle_rules_intervals  — rank 3, 163.5 ± 23.8 nats behind the best (6.9× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -994.2

Refinement of `tenenbaum_rules_similarity`: people do Bayesian concept learning over mathematical rules and intervals as in that model, but they discount the evidence of the examples — each example counts for only a fraction (or a multiple) of a fully independent random draw from the concept, by a fitted evidence weight — so the size principle is tempered and generalization stays broader than strong sampling predicts, reaching targets well outside the examples' range. The single change is this fitted tempering of the likelihood (the strength of the size principle), which the original fixes at full strength.

## shared_property_match_fraction  — rank 4, 300.1 ± 42.4 nats behind the best (7.1× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1130.8

People do not weigh competing concepts or the size of each concept; instead they note every property that all the examples have in common (parity, final digit, tens decade, being a multiple, power, square, cube or prime, lying within the examples' range) and endorse a target in proportion to how many of those shared properties it also has. The more of the examples' common properties the target matches, the more likely a "yes", regardless of how many numbers in 1-100 share those properties.

## featural_exemplar_similarity  — rank 5, 301.8 ± 34.5 nats behind the best (8.7× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1132.6

People do not entertain candidate rules at all; instead they judge a target by its featural similarity to each example they saw, treating numbers as bundles of salient properties (parity, divisibility by 3, 4, 5 and 10, last digit, decade, being prime, square or a power of two). Each example's similarity falls off exponentially with the number of properties on which it and the target disagree, and the chance of saying "yes" rises with the average similarity across the examples (an exemplar, GCM-style judgment with no size principle).

## tenenbaum_rules_similarity  — rank 6, 309.8 ± 50.8 nats behind the best (6.1× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1140.6

Bayesian concept learning over 33 mathematical rules (odd, even, squares,
cubes, primes, multiples of 3-12, powers of 2-10, ending in 1-9) and every
interval of 1-100. The rules share a prior fraction lambda equally; the
intervals share the rest by an Erlang density on their size (scale sigma).
Examples are sampled from the concept (the size principle), 10% of them
uniformly from 1-100, and "yes" is the posterior probability that the
concept contains the target.

## log_magnitude_exemplar_similarity  — rank 7, 559.1 ± 45.9 nats behind the best (12.2× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -1389.9

People ignore arithmetic rules entirely and generalize by exemplar similarity on a compressed (logarithmic) mental number line: the chance of saying "yes" falls off smoothly with the target's distance to the nearest example, and the falloff is wider when the examples themselves are spread far apart. This disagrees most sharply with the rule-based best model on rule-consistent targets far from every example (e.g. 64 after 16,32,2,8 — rules say yes, similarity says unlikely) and on rule-violating targets nestled among the examples (e.g. 20 after 16,32,2,8 — rules say no, similarity says likely).
