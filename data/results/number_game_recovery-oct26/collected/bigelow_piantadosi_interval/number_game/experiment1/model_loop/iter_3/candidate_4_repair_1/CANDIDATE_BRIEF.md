# Candidate Brief

Refine the incumbent: `tempered_evidence_decision_gain` — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -791.2. Its hypothesis, as its author stated it:

> Refinement of decision_gain_concept_learning: people do the same Bayesian concept learning over the 42 weighted rules and all intervals of 1-100 (size principle, 10% noisy examples) and turn their belief into a yes/no answer through the same inferred decision gain on the log-odds, but they do not weigh the examples as fully independent draws from the concept — the one change, taken from the incumbent, is that each example's evidence counts for an inferred fraction (or multiple) of a full draw. Tempering thus decides which concepts people entertain (how broadly they generalize), while the decision gain alone decides how they hedge between belief and answer, with no flat guessing floor: targets with near-zero belief still get near-zero yeses, unlike under the incumbent's guessing.

Its source is `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/5af1c6040af4ffd9/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment1/model_loop/models/tempered_evidence_decision_gain.py`. Read it before you write anything.

Produce the version of this model you believe would beat it on the current data: keep the mechanism that makes it win and change what it gets wrong — a different functional form, prior or normalisation of its mechanism, a cue it ignores, or a component taken from another model in `refinement_menu.md`. For this slot the rule against grafting cues from other models onto a hypothesis is lifted, and so is the rule against composing mechanisms: you may add a component from another model. Two things still hold: make **one** deliberate, stated change (a grab-bag of cues added to fit better is not a refinement), and change something that matters — the novelty gate rejects a candidate whose predictions match a live model's across the stimulus space, the incumbent's included.

Say in `hypothesis.md` which model you refined and what you changed: that is part of the claim.

If `critiques.md` is present, prioritise a hypothesis that addresses one of the significant discrepancies it reports.
