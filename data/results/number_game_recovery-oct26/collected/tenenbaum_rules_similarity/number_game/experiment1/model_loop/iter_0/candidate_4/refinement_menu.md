# Refinement menu

The models you may refine, other than the incumbent `bigelow_piantadosi_interval`. Each entry is one mechanism: its hypothesis in full as its author stated it, how it stands, and where its source is. This is a menu, not a list of what is ruled out: a pruned model lost to the best model on the data it was scored on, by the stated margin, but its mechanism may be partly right — and a model that lost narrowly is the most promising target here. Read the source of the model you pick before you write anything.

## Live models other than the incumbent (in the set; best first)

### bigelow_piantadosi_independent — rank 1, 3.3 ± 6.6 nats behind the best (0.5× dse: statistically tied with the best), ELPD-LOO -1288.7

**Hypothesis:** Bayesian concept learning over 42 rules (powers of 2-10, multiples of 3-12, final digit 1-9, contained digit 1-9, primes, even, odd, squares, cubes) and every interval of 1-100, with a prior weight inferred for each rule separately and a share p_mix for the rules as a group; intervals are equally likely. Examples are sampled from the concept (the size principle), 10% of them uniformly from 1-100, and "yes" is the posterior probability that the concept contains the target.
