# Candidate Brief

Refine the incumbent: `erlang_interval_size_prior` — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -1276.6. Its hypothesis, as its author stated it:

> Refinement of bigelow_piantadosi_interval: people do Bayesian concept learning over the same 42 rules and every interval of 1-100 (size principle, 10% of examples random, "yes" = posterior probability the concept contains the target), but their prior over intervals depends on how wide an interval is rather than where it lies. Following Tenenbaum's original number game, interval width has an Erlang prior with an inferred scale, so people a priori favour moderately sized ranges and disfavour both tiny and near-total ranges, which controls how far they generalize beyond the examples' span.

Its source is `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/45bd45c333332e1a/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment1/model_loop/models/erlang_interval_size_prior.py`. Read it before you write anything.

Produce the version of this model you believe would beat it on the current data: keep the mechanism that makes it win and change what it gets wrong — a different functional form, prior or normalisation of its mechanism, a cue it ignores, or a component taken from another model in `refinement_menu.md`. For this slot the rule against grafting cues from other models onto a hypothesis is lifted, and so is the rule against composing mechanisms: you may add a component from another model. Two things still hold: make **one** deliberate, stated change (a grab-bag of cues added to fit better is not a refinement), and change something that matters — the novelty gate rejects a candidate whose predictions match a live model's across the stimulus space, the incumbent's included.

Say in `hypothesis.md` which model you refined and what you changed: that is part of the claim.

If `critiques.md` is present, prioritise a hypothesis that addresses one of the significant discrepancies it reports.
