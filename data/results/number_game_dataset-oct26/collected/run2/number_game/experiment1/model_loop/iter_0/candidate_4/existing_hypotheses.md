# Existing hypotheses

Each model below is ONE cognitive hypothesis, with how it stands on the current data by ELPD-LOO (best first). `elpd_diff ± dse` is a model's deficit against the best and the standard error of that difference (with the responses to each stimulus pair counted together, as they are correlated): within about 2·dse the two are statistically tied on this data; beyond it the model has lost. "PSIS-LOO unreliable" means the estimate itself is untrustworthy (too many high-Pareto-k trials), not that the model is bad. Propose a hypothesis that is genuinely different from these, or a refinement of a single one of them — never a combination of several.

## bigelow_piantadosi_independent  — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -1792.1

Bayesian concept learning over 42 rules (powers of 2-10, multiples of
3-12, final digit 1-9, contained digit 1-9, primes, even, odd, squares,
cubes) and every interval of 1-100, with a prior weight inferred for each
rule separately and a share p_mix for the rules as a group; intervals are
equally likely. Examples are sampled from the concept (the size
principle), 10% of them uniformly from 1-100, and "yes" is the posterior
probability that the concept contains the target.

## bigelow_piantadosi_interval  — rank 1, 10.0 ± 19.4 nats behind the best (0.5× dse: statistically tied with the best), ELPD-LOO -1802.1

Bayesian concept learning over 42 rules (powers of 2-10, multiples of
3-12, final digit 1-9, contained digit 1-9, primes, even, odd, squares,
cubes) and every interval of 1-100, with a prior weight inferred for each
rule separately and a share p_mix for the rules as a group. An interval's
prior follows a Beta density over its midpoint, with both shapes
inferred, so concepts in some parts of 1-100 are favoured. Examples are
sampled from the concept (the size principle), 10% of them uniformly from
1-100, and "yes" is the posterior probability that the concept contains
the target.

## tenenbaum_rules_similarity  — rank 2, 262.6 ± 63.9 nats behind the best (4.1× dse: distinguishable from the best — it has lost on this data), ELPD-LOO -2054.7

Bayesian concept learning over 33 mathematical rules (odd, even, squares,
cubes, primes, multiples of 3-12, powers of 2-10, ending in 1-9) and every
interval of 1-100. The rules share a prior fraction lambda equally; the
intervals share the rest by an Erlang density on their size (scale sigma).
Examples are sampled from the concept (the size principle), 10% of them
uniformly from 1-100, and "yes" is the posterior probability that the
concept contains the target.
