# Candidate Brief

Refine the incumbent: `conservative_evidence_interval_concepts` — rank 0, the best model on this data, ELPD-LOO -1618.5. Its hypothesis, as its author stated it:

> Refinement of `bigelow_piantadosi_interval`: people do the same Bayesian concept learning over 42 arithmetic rules and every interval of 1-100 (a prior weight inferred for each rule, an interval prior given by a Beta density over its midpoint, examples sampled from the concept by the size principle with 10% noise), but they are conservative updaters: they weight the evidence of the examples by a single inferred strength rather than at full Bayesian value, so the posterior over concepts is flatter (strength below 1) or sharper (above 1) than the ideal learner's. The one change is this evidence-weighting exponent on the examples' likelihood, which governs how quickly generalization tightens around the narrowest consistent concept as examples accumulate.

Its source is `/scr/wurgaft/auto-psych/agent_trees/80aefb383357367b/repo/_runs/cell_1/experiment1/model_loop/models/conservative_evidence_interval_concepts.py`. Read it before you write anything.

Produce the version of this model you believe would beat it on the current data: keep the mechanism that makes it win and change what it gets wrong — a different functional form, prior or normalisation of its mechanism, a cue it ignores, or a component taken from another model in `refinement_menu.md`. For this slot the rule against grafting cues from other models onto a hypothesis is lifted, and so is the rule against composing mechanisms: you may add a component from another model. Two things still hold: make **one** deliberate, stated change (a grab-bag of cues added to fit better is not a refinement), and change something that matters — the novelty gate rejects a candidate whose predictions match a live model's across the stimulus space, the incumbent's included.

Say in `hypothesis.md` which model you refined and what you changed: that is part of the claim.

If `critiques.md` is present, prioritise a hypothesis that addresses one of the significant discrepancies it reports.
